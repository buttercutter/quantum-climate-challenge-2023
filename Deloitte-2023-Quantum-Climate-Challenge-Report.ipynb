    "## Task 1A \n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "Create a quantum algorithm, a quantum hybrid or quantum inspired solution, that calculates the minimum of the  potential energy surface of combinations gas molecules (CO 2 , H 2 O, N 2 ) and ions (Mg 2+ , Ni 2+ , Fe 2+ , Co 2+ , Zn 2+ , Mn 2+ , Cu 2+ ).\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "#### Classical algorithm\n",
    "Our team calculated energy levels with a classical computation in Quantistry solution for the combination molecules: \n",
    "- Co 2+ CO2, Co 2+ H2O, Co 2+ N2\n",
    "- Cu 2+ CO2, Cu 2+ H2O, Cu 2+ N2\n",
    "- Fe 2+ CO2, Fe 2+ H2O, Fe 2+ N2\n",
    "- Mn 2+ CO2, Mn 2+ H2O, Mn 2+ N2\n",
    "- Ni 2+ CO2, Ni 2+ H2O, Ni 2+ N2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum algorithm\n",
    "Our team calculated energy levels with a quantum computation with Qiskit and IBM Quantum for the energy combinations:\n",
    "- Co 2+ CO2\n",
    "- Fe 2+ CO2\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a quantum algorithm UCCSD for the molecular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our most time consuming problem was to analyse how to reduce the problem size with a quantum computer approach. We researched the FreeCore and ActiveSpace transformers in Qiskit and raised two issues to ask more detailed information on the usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate calculation was also a time consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach was to use the Quantistry coordinates and use those in the quantum computation and then reduce the problem size with a transformer. \n",
    "#### BOPES\n",
    "We implemented a Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface for the calculations. The atomic structure did not complete in time, so the final calculation with the BOPES approach requires more work. \n",
    "#### Running the algorithm\n",
    "The runtime of the algorithm in real quantum computer is high mostly because of the wait que in the real machine. \n",
    "We run the algorithm on a simulation environment with the following results. \n",
    "#### Quantistry\n",
    "With the Quantistry we created a calculations for each combination of the interactions. \n",
    "#### References\n",
    "During the task we created issues for questions that came up during the task. \n",
