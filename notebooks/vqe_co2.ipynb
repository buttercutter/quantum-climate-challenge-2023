    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE is a variational algorithm for calculating the ground state of some given hamiltonian H which we call it $\\psi_g$ that satisfied $H \\left|\\psi_g\\right> =E_g\\left|\\psi_g\\right>$. For an arbitrary normalized wavefunction $\\psi_f$, the expectation value $\\left<\\psi_f|H|\\psi_f \\right>$ is always not lower than the ground state energy unless $\\psi_f = \\psi_g$ to some phase factor (here we assume there is no degeneracy in ground state). Based on that fact, if we use a parameterized wavefunction $\\psi_\\theta$, e.g. given by a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with parameters $\\theta$, we can give an approximation for the ground state enery and wavefunction by minimizing the expectation value of $H$. In practical quantum hardware, this algorithm can be realized in a quantum-neural hybrid paradigm with the gradient calculated using finite difference or paremeter shift in quantum hardware and the optimization using gradient descent method in classical computer. While in a numerical simulation, we can just calculate the gradients using automatic differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the ground state energy for molecules is often important for quantum chemistry tasks since it can be used to find out the atom structure of the molecules. In the simulation of molecules, we do not consider the motion of nuclei which means we fix the nuclear coordinates of its constituent atoms. We only consider the electrons in the molecules since the nuclei are way heavier than the electrons and thus the energy carried by phonons is negligible or can be reconsidered using Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Strictly speaking, the eletrons lives in continuous space, thus the Hilbert space is of infinite dimensions. To conduct a practical calculation, we only preserve some important single-particle basis, e.g. the low energy atomic orbitals. In the second quantization formalism, we can represent these atomic orbitals as $c_i^\\dagger|0>$. By considering the interactions of nuclei and electrons as background and also the electron-electron interaction, a molecules hamiltonian can in generally be represented as $H = \\sum_{i, j} h_{i,j} c_i^\\dagger c_j + \\sum_{i, j, k, l} \\alpha_{i, j, k, l} c_i^\\dagger c_j^\\dagger c_k c_l$. Notice that the spin index is also absorbed into the orbital index. There are many softwares that can give these parameters in H such as `pyscf` which we will use later in this tutorial. Now we have a fermionic description for moleculars. By using a mapping from fermionic operators to spin operators such as Jordan-Wigner transformation or Bravyi-Kitaev transformation, we can map the fermionic hamiltonian to a spin hamiltonian which is more compatible with quantum computer. For a spin hamiltonian, we can easily use a PQC to construct a trail wavefunction and conduct the VQE algorithm. In the following part of this tutorial, we will demonstrate a complete example of how to use TensorCircuit to simulate VQE algorithm on Molecules."

    "The number of spin orbitals for a molecule can be calculated based on the number of electrons in the molecule. Each electron will occupy one spin orbital, and there are two spin orbitals per occupied orbital: one with a spin-up electron and one with a spin-down electron. The total number of spin orbitals is then equal to 2 times the number of electrons.\n",

    "This is because the number of spin orbitals is proportional to the number of electrons in the molecule and the type of basis set used to describe the molecule's electronic structure. The sto-3g basis set used in these examples is a relatively small basis set, which results in a smaller number of spin orbitals."
